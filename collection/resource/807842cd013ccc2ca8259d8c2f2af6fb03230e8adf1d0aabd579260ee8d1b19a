				<p>The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the national policy direction for the delivery of housing through the planning system. It requires local authorities to undertake a Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment&nbsp;to help identify potential sites for residential development. The <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> is an assessment of how many units can be accommodated on identified sites and the timeframe for when these sites are likely to be available. The exercise also identifies constraints associated with bringing potential sites forward and how and when these can be removed to help improve the potential for housing.</p><p>The Council produced an initial <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> that had a base date of 1 April 2008. This was undertaken in full accordance with the <abbr title="Communities and Local Government">CLG</abbr> guidance. The Council consulted on the draft methodology of the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> and subsequently on the draft findings of the initial <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr>.</p><p>In line with the government guidance on producing <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessments">SHLAAs</abbr>, the Council now produces annual updates of the initial <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> with a base date of 1 April. Updates take account of changing circumstances on particular sites and the general housing market. The latest draft <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> document has a base date of 1 April 2018. Site details have been updated where they have&nbsp;changed. This may&nbsp;include&nbsp;a site gaining planning permission or commencing construction. The update also takes account of new sites that have come forward or have the potential to come forward that were not included in previous versions of the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr>. It should be noted that this is a 'snapshot' picture of sites at that time and the status of some sites may have changed since this date</p><p>The results of the exercise will help feed into the emerging Local&nbsp;Plan, which will replace the Unitary Development Plan and seek to identify sufficient land for housing up to 2037.</p><h2><abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> 2018</h2><p>The findings of the 1 April 2018&nbsp;<abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> and&nbsp;site specific information&nbsp;is available to download below. Given the number and detail of the sites, the full site listing document has also been broken down in order to reduce file sizes and allow for faster downloads.</p><p>The SHLAA 2018 site boundaries are also available to view via our online mapping system. Please note the SHLAA 2018 shows the position at 1 April 2018 - work may have started on site, other sites may have been granted planning permission or planning permission may have expired since that date.</p><p>Link to SHLAA online map: <a class="inlinelink" href="https://maps.bury.gov.uk/webmaplayers8/Map.aspx?MapName=Bury_SHLAA_External" target="_self" title="Bury Council web site ">Maps - Bury SHLAA</a>.</p><p>In addition, a detailed folder of all the individual site schedules and location plans are available to view at the Planning reception in 3 Knowsley Place, Duke Street, Bury.</p><p>Hard copies of the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> summary report can be purchased for £10. If you wish to purchase a hard copy of the summary report along with all of the detailed site schedules, this is available for £200. Alternatively, you can purchase the summary report and site schedules on a CD for £20. Please contact us for further details.</p><p>A Deliverability Summary Statement&nbsp;will also be produced based on the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> 2018 which sets out the five-year land supply position as of 1 April 2018.</p><p>The Five Year Supply Statement is available on our <a href="https://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10744" class="inlinearticle ">Housing Land</a>&nbsp;page.</p><h3>Submitting additional sites</h3><p>The <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> will be updated on an annual basis (1 April base date). If you want&nbsp;to suggest an additional site(s) you are requested to do so using the official&nbsp;online form. Please note that sites suggested will not appear in the formal <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> document until such time as it is updated. Suggested sites will, however, be put on the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> database and will be considered as part of the&nbsp;preparation of the Local Plan. Sites submitted for residential development as part of the Local Plan 'Call for Sites' will also be considered for inclusion in the next update of the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr>.</p><p class="gossBtnPrimary"><a class="inlinelink" href="https://burymbc-self.achieveservice.com/AchieveForms/?mode=fill&amp;form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-921d17f8-8250-4eaa-8a54-584a47ed47d9/AF-Stage-f680910d-63f4-4817-9650-e1dcb44f2b80/definition.json&amp;process=1&amp;process_uri=sandbox-processes://AF-Process-921d17f8-8250-4eaa-8a54-584a47ed47d9&amp;process_id=AF-Process-921d17f8-8250-4eaa-8a54-584a47ed47d9" target="_self" title="Online form ">SHLAA site proposal - suggest an additional site</a></p><h3><abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> consultation</h3><p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> 2018 has been uploaded for information at this time to help support the emergence of Bury's Local Plan.&nbsp;If you have any comments on the findings of the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> you are welcome to submit comments or discuss them with us.</p><h3>Brownfield land register</h3><p>Local Authorities are required to prepare, maintain and publish a register of previously developed (brownfield) land suitable for housing. The brownfield land register was first published on 19 December 2017, and updated on 13 December 2018,&nbsp;and is effectively a subset of the sites included within the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr>.</p><p>There are two part of the brownfield land register:</p><ul><li>Part 1 includes parcels of brownfield land at least 0.25 hectares in size or capable of supporting at least 5 dwellings, that the Council considers to be suitable and available for residential development and for development to be achievable.</li><li>Part 2 is a subset of Part 1 and will include only those sites that have been granted permission in principle for residential development, having been through the necessary publicity, notification and consultation requirements. No sites have been included on Part 2 of the brownfield land register by the Council at the current time.</li></ul><p>A report setting out the methodology and summarising the findings can be downloaded below, together with a .csv file listing all the sites in the format prescribed by the government.</p><p>An interactive map showing the sites on Bury's brownfield land register is available to view here: Brownfield land register online map: <a class="inlinelink" href="https://maps.bury.gov.uk/webmaplayers8/Map.aspx?x=380961&amp;y=411007&amp;resolution=0.5&amp;epsg=27700&amp;mapname=bury_shlaa_external&amp;baseLayer=GreyScaleBury&amp;datalayers=Brownfield%20Land%20Register%20now%2CBury%20Council%2CselectFeaturesControl_container" target="_self" title="Bury Council web site ">Maps - Brownfield land register sites in Bury</a>.</p><p>Please note that all of the sites included in the brownfield land register are also included in the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr>, which is a much more comprehensive list of land that has been identified as available for housing. Unlike the brownfield land register, the <abbr title="Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment">SHLAA</abbr> includes dwellings on brownfield sites that are under construction, small sites with a capacity of less than 5 dwellings or 0.25 hectares in size, and sites that are not completely brownfield in nature. Inclusion on Part 1 of the brownfield land register does not mean that the site would automatically be granted planning permission for residential development.</p><p>Bury's brownfield land register is licensed under the Open Government Licence 3.0.

Please see the self and custom build register web page for details:</p><p class="alert-LinkBox"><a href="https://www.bury.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=12099" class="inlinearticle ">Self and custom build register</a></p><h3>Housing Delivery Test Action Plan</h3><p>The Council has published its Housing Delivery Test Action Plan for 2019 to demonstrate what it will do to increase the number homes to be built across Bury.
