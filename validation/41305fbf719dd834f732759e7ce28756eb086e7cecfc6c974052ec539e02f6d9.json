Improvements should also be made to existing local bus stop infrastructure and a financial contribution towards improving local bus services is provided. Provision should be made for the retention and enhancement of existing landscape buffers with locally characteristic native tree and shrub planting, particularly on the western and northern boundaries. A connection should be provided to the local sewerage system at the nearest point of adequate capacity, in collaboration with the service provider. Development of the site should be through a Green Infrastructure framework and landscape led masterplan.

This assessment is based on all materials currently stored on site being removed. The former stables are likely to contain droppings from pigeons and other vermin, which will present a health hazard to demolition workers, and must be removed in a controlled manner. Wooden doors and other items are probably coated with lead paint. Careful control of dust during demolition will be necessary. It is recommended that an asbestos survey of the buildings be conducted prior to demolition. On removal of the demolition rubble and existing floor slabs, it is recommended that the Site soils be inspected and photographed for signs of undetected on site contamination, particularly of oil spills.\"","01/10/2017","01/10/2019",""],"row-number":14},{"code":"pattern-constraint","column-number":9,"message":"The value \"pending permission \" in row 15 and column 9 does not conform to the pattern constraint of \"(?i)(permissioned|not permissioned|pending decision)\"","message-data":{"constraint":"(?i)(permissioned|not permissioned|pending decision)","value":"pending permission "},"row":["http://opendatacommunities.org/id/district-council/rother","RDCBLR0016","\"Land at Moleynes Mead, Fryatts Way, Bexhill\"","0.451064","50.852945","https://www.rother.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brownfieldlandregister_siteplan_rdcblr0016_011019.pdf","0.42","not owned by a public authority","pending permission ","","","http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2017/2452/P&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2014/2019/P&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2014/226/P&from=planningSearch","yes","13","13","","“This brownfield site is part of a larger site that includes greenfield land.
